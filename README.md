Technical challenge for HMRC (VOA) job application

Welcome to my Github repository for the HMRC (VOA) job application. The files can be identified by their descriptions; the solution and files
that I coded for Step 1 are appropriately named 'Files for Step 1' and are all included in the first release and can be downloaded as a zip file. 
The files for Step 2 are under the name Step 2 Challenge. I suggest the best way to view both of these solutions is through the Release section, the code runs from the Program.cs file.
